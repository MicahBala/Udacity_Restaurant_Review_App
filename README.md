# Udacity Front End Project

---

## Project Overview:

This is a final project for the Udacity Frontend Nanodegree program. It requires the following:

- Making a website (starter code provided by Udacity) fully-responsive to be viewed on a variaty of devices.
- Make the website achieve WAI-ARAI accessibility standard.
- Once the site is visited, it should be cashed in the local browser incase of poor or low/no connectivity to the server.

## Downloading and Running the app

Clone the repository or download a zipped file from the udacity [github page](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) this will provide the starter code for the project.

If you don't have python stalled on your system, head to the python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
